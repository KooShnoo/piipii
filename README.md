Eventually a save editor for Pokémon Rumble :)

For now, you can see your collection of Pokémon, or as Ambrella calls it, your "PiiBox". Exciting!

## what's up with the name?
The name is a pun based on the made-up language *toki pona*. Bear with me here: childhood bug-catching and bug-fighting was a major inspiration for the first Pokémon games.  And 'bug' in toki pona is 'pipi'. Additionally, in Pokémon Rumble's code the Pokémon are internally called 'pii', just as human avatars for the wii are called 'mii'. So put together, pii + pipi = piipii. I think it's cute. Any attempts to ridicule the name will be met with frowns and disapproval.

## Known Issues
There's uhhh, no error handling. If something breaks, you can check your browser's javascript console to see what went wrong; but, the only way to fix it will be to reload. A common error is uploading an invalid save file, which causes a panic; if you accidentally do that, just reload. I'll fix it properly later lol
